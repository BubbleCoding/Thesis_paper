abstract = {Cyber physical systems (CPSs) find their application in different domains, including smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0. The increasing degree of interaction among CPSs leads to unpredictable and partially unexpected behavior. The major steps to manage emerging behavior in CPSs are taken in the design process. Although a high number of methods and tools already exist from related disciplines (including complex system research, embedded system design, and self-organization), there is no comprehensive toolset available to address the extensive CPS design process. This chapter presents a proposal for a common CPS design toolset. It combines existing and emerging tools to design, simulate, evaluate, and deploy solutions for complex, real-world problems using evolutionary algorithms on the example of swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).},

abstract = {Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements. Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore, the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible applications that could run on top of this system such as residential demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented, which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy analyser for a selection of common household appliances.},
