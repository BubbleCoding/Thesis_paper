This chapter iterative design process of the artefact.
\section{My Topic}


\section{Coding with Python}
Python was the only language used in this project. This was chosen as Python is the go to language for programming with AI models (REF) and all major(if not all) models have python support.

Specifically python version 3.12.3 running on a the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL) running Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. WSL is a windows feature that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows while in windows without having to run a virtual machine. You control the Linux distribution fully through the terminal.

\section{AI models}

\subsection{Whisper}

\subsection{Llama}

\subsection{Image generating models: Stable Diffusion}
The chosen image generation model is Stable Diffusion version stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 \cite{StableDiffusionGit}
